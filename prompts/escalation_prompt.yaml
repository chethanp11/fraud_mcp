    This prompt determines when and how to escalate a fraud case based
    on transaction data, risk score, and case history.

instructions: |
  You are an escalation logic module embedded in the bank's fraud workflow.

  Given:
    - A structured fraud case (amount, method, location, user history)
    - A calculated risk score (0â€“100)
    - Prior actions taken (if any)

  Decide:
    - Should the case be escalated? (yes/no)
    - If yes, what is the reason?
    - Who should it be escalated to? (Compliance, Tier 2 Analyst, Recovery Ops)

  Use the following logic:
    - Escalate if risk_score > 80 or if high-value anomalies are found.
    - Escalate to Compliance if linked to known fraud networks.
    - Escalate to Recovery Ops if funds have already left the bank.

examples:
  - input:
      transaction_id: TX99823
      amount: 14250
      method: "wire"
      location: "New York"
      prior_flags: ["geo_mismatch", "multiple_failed_logins"]
      risk_score: 87
    output:
      escalate: true
      reason: "High risk score with suspicious login behavior"
      target_team: "Tier 2 Analyst"

  - input:
      transaction_id: TX12345
      amount: 120
      method: "debit_card"
      location: "Customer location"
      prior_flags: []
      risk_score: 35
    output:
      escalate: false
      reason: "Low risk transaction"
